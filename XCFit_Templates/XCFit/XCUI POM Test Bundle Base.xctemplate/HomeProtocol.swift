 This is sample code created by XCFit Framework and can be edited/Removed as per your project need. You can also re-arrange Xcode Groups and directories as per your need.
 
 Swift is protocol oriented language so feel to start with Protocol per scren. Here is example of sample protocol for the homescreen. We can implement this protocol in the XCTest method as needed or we can write some extensions to support Testing.

import XCTest

protocol HomeProtocol {
    
    func launchApp()
    func tapHomebutton()
    
    
}
